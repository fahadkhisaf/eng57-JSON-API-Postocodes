# 1st we need a way to talk HTTP
## we'll use the requests package that is very stable and widly used

# this is a standard py library  no need to install:
# import time

# time.sleep(1)

# requests is not a standard library and must be install with a package manager
    # package is an external library of code, not native to python (or vanilla python)
    # A package manager, install and manages this package

# python, ruby, javascript, java, C# almost all moderns languages have a package manager.

import requests

# I want to make a get request to get more info on my postcode
# I need to check my API documentation
# then build the target url with path and arguments
#  then I need to use the package request to make the request
# I wil, receive a JSON that I need to parse into a dictionary

path = 'http://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/'
arguments = 'e147le'

#Buil ur
url_target = path + arguments
print(url_target)

#Make request and capture response
response = requests.get(url_target)

print(response)
print(type(response))

# Parsing or getting the dictionary out
print(response.json())
response_dictionary = response.json()

print(type(response_dictionary))

# for key in response_dictionary.keys():
#     print(key)

result_dictionary = response_dictionary['result']
